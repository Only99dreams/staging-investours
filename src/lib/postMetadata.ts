/**
 * The single source of truth for how a post is presented when it is shared.
 *
 * Every surface that needs a post's title, description, canonical URL or preview
 * image goes through here: the /post/:id server-rendered page, the /api/share
 * redirect, and the client-side tag updates when someone opens a post in the
 * app. Logic that exists twice is logic that will disagree, and the earlier
 * duplication between src/lib/share.ts and api/share.ts had already drifted.
 *
 * Everything is pure and side-effect free. The one exception is
 * `resolvePostPreviewImage`, which may perform a network HEAD to confirm a
 * video's stored frame exists; the client should prefer the synchronous
 * `derivePostPreview` and the server may use the resolving variant.
 *
 * This module is imported by files in `api/`. Vercel compiles each function with
 * esbuild before tracing it, so those imports are bundled in and the function
 * stays self-contained - verified with @vercel/nft against a real esbuild output,
 * not assumed.
